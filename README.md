# About Hackathon Magento Honey Spam

This Magento Extension adds a field which is hidden with JavaScript to the Customer Register and the Product Review Form which looks like the URL Field of a Wordpress Comment Form.
If this field gets filled and the Form is send, there appears a error message and nothing will be safed.

There is also a check if this form is to fast transmitted, a human normally takes a couple of Seconds or more.

You can enable and disable the functionalitys or set the time how long it should take to transmit this forms in the Magento Admin Backend.

Freshly added: Regex-checking on all input-fields to determine a loose index for spam-level. It is not the
most accurate thing at all, but it may prevent the low-end spam ("broadband spam"), though its not yet configurable

## Installation

Just copy the App folder to your Magento root directory and refresh your Magento Cache in the Shop Backend.


## Testing ##

After the Installation you should be able to find a input field with the id="url" in the Customer Register and in the Product Review Form, which should be hidden with JS.
